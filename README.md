Introduction: 
The advancement of technology has made it crucial for companies to have a reliable and secure network infrastructure to support their operations. This project focuses on designing a network infrastructure for a UAE-based company that has remote locations across different cities and countries. The network design considers WAN technologies such as Frame Relay and PPP networking between sites, as well as security measures like PPP with Authentication, Firewall Server, Syslog and NTP, and VPN technology (Site-to-Site VPN) to ensure a high level of protection against cyber threats. Additional security measures, such as implementing an AAA server or deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), are also considered as part of the design.
The objective of this project is to implement a wide area network (WAN) for a company with three branches in different cities/countries while maintaining network security as the primary goal. The project aims to provide reliable connectivity and secure data transmission among the branches.
The proposed network topology includes various network devices like routers, switches, firewalls, and VPN concentrators, each with specific technologies applied to them. The addressing table provides details of IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other necessary information. This project document provides a comprehensive design proposal that meets the client's requirements and constraints while also considering assumptions and limitations.
 
The Client: 
The client in this project is a fictitious UAE-based company named "ABC Trading Company," which has multiple remote locations across different cities and countries. ABC Trading Company is a medium-sized business involved in the import and export of various goods, including electronics, textiles, and machinery. The company has a growing demand for a reliable and secure network infrastructure to support its day-to-day operations, including communication, data transfer, and collaboration between its different locations. The company has three branches located in New York, London, and Tokyo, each with approximately 200 employees. The branches need to communicate and exchange data regularly for efficient and effective business operations. However, the company faces security threats from cyber attacks due to the sensitive nature of their data. Therefore, the client requires a secure and reliable WAN to connect the three branches.
To meet the company's networking needs, the proposed network design includes WAN technologies such as Frame Relay and PPP networking between sites, as well as security measures like PPP with Authentication, Firewall Server, Syslog and NTP, and VPN technology (Site-to-Site VPN) to ensure a high level of protection against cyber threats. The proposed network topology and addressing tables are designed to provide a robust and secure network infrastructure that meets the requirements and constraints of the client.
 
 
Requirements and Constraints: 
Site-to-Site VPN: 
Site-to-Site VPN allows for secure communication between the branches over the internet. The VPN connection will be established between the branch routers and will ensure that data is transmitted securely. This technology is critical to the client as it ensures secure transmission of confidential data across the branches. 
 AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting): 
AAA provides a centralized authentication and authorization mechanism that ensures only authorized users can access the network resources. It also provides accounting, which allows for tracking of user activities on the network. AAA is important for the client as it ensures that only authorized users can access the network resources and helps in auditing user activities. 
 Frame Relay: 
Frame Relay is a WAN technology that allows for the transmission of data over a shared network. It provides bandwidth on demand and allows for efficient utilization of network resources. This technology is important for the client as it ensures efficient data transmission among the branches. 
 Firewall: 
A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as the first line of defense against cyber attacks. This technology is critical for the client as it protects the network from cyber threats and ensures the safety of their sensitive data. 
PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): 
PPP is a WAN protocol that enables the transmission of data over a serial interface. It provides a reliable and secure connection between the branches. This technology is important for the client as it ensures reliable and secure data transmission among the branches. 
 Network Topology: 
The proposed network topology for the company includes a hub and spoke architecture with a central location in New York and branch locations in London and Tokyo. Each branch will be connected to the central location via a Site-to-Site VPN. The central location will have a firewall to protect the network from cyber attacks. The network devices used in this topology are Cisco routers and switches.

The following table shows the addressing scheme for the proposed network topology: 
  
WAN Security: 
To ensure WAN security, the following security controls were applied: 
The proposed network design for ABC Trading Company includes various security measures such as PPP with Authentication, Firewall Server, Syslog and NTP, and VPN technology (Site-to-Site VPN) to protect against cyber threats. PPP with Authentication provides a secure connection between sites by encrypting data and using authentication protocols, while the Firewall Server filters traffic and protects against unauthorized access.
Syslog and NTP are used for network time synchronization and log management, which helps in detecting and mitigating security threats. The VPN technology (Site-to-Site VPN) is used to encrypt data transmitted over the internet, which provides an additional layer of security against cyber threats. All these security controls satisfy the requirements and constraints of the client and provide a robust and secure WAN infrastructure.
To ensure WAN security, the following security controls were applied: 
Site-to-Site VPN: 
The VPN connection will use the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) 
For authentication and authorization, the proposed network will utilize AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) technology. AAA provides a centralized way to manage access control and authentication policies. This will ensure that only authorized users have access to the company's network resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. 
 For network connectivity between the different branches, a site-to-site VPN (Virtual Private Network) will be implemented. Site-to-site VPN provides secure communication between different sites over the internet. This technology allows remote access and data transfer to be done in a secure manner, without the need for expensive leased lines. The VPN tunnel will use the IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) protocol for secure data transmission. 
 To protect the network from unauthorized access and attacks, a firewall will be installed at the edge of the network. The firewall will be configured to permit only authorized traffic in and out of the network, and to block any potentially harmful traffic. The firewall will be complemented by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to detect and prevent any attempts to compromise the network security. 
For WAN connectivity, Frame Relay will be used as the WAN technology. Frame Relay is a high-speed packet-switched technology that allows data transfer over a wide area network. It provides a costeffective way of connecting multiple sites to a central location. The company will use a Frame Relay network to connect the different branches to the central headquarters. 
Lastly, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) will be used as the data link protocol for the WAN links. PPP is a protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes. It provides authentication, encryption, and compression services for data transmitted over a point-to-point link. 
Firewall: The firewall will be installed at the edge of the network to prevent unauthorized access and attacks. The firewall will be configured to permit only authorized traffic in and out of the network, and to block any potentially harmful traffic. 
AAA: The AAA technology will be used to manage access control and authentication policies. This will ensure that only authorized users have access to the company's network resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. 
Assumptions and Limitations: 
The proposed network design for ABC Trading Company is based on several assumptions and limitations. The design assumes that the network devices used are reliable and have the necessary hardware and software capabilities to support the proposed plan. The proposed network design assumes that the company has the necessary hardware and software infrastructure to support the proposed network topology and technologies. The proposed network design also assumes that the company has the necessary resources to implement and maintain the network, including trained personnel and sufficient funding. A potential limitation of the proposed network design is that the use of a Frame Relay network may limit the bandwidth available for data transfer between the different branches.
